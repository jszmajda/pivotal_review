## Pivotal Review

The intention of this app is to show a random selection of recent
stories and allow you to assign each some metric of value produced by
implementing the story. The ideas is to track efficacy of story choice
and value per point ratios in order to lead to better project
management.

It's also a project for me to learn node.js, express.js, and related
technologies ;)

## TODOs

- Choose random set of stories from project
- That whole rating thing.. ;)
- Modeling and storing review data (mongoose.js?)

## Setup

- install Node.js (latest I guess)
- npm install -d # dependent module installation
- nodemon app.coffee
